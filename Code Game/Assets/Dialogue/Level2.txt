AvaWet:So...
...When do I get to raise the dead?
Larry:Soon.
How about I teach you 2 things this lesson to speed it up?
Ava:Yeah!
Larry:OK. So you know about strings.
Ava:I do!
Larry:Now lets talk about numbers.
If you want to store a number in a variable you store it as an int.
Int is short for integer which means whole number.
You would write...
int catAge = 14;
where catAge can be whatever you want as it's the variable name.
And 14 is the number we're storing.
I've also added an if statement this time.
See if you can work out how it's working.
