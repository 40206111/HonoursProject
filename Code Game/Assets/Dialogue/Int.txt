GWEr:What even is an int?!
GWHa:Well... int is short for integer
Integer means whole number.
So thats numbers like; 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.....1000000...
GWEr:And not numbers like 1.5, 0.4, 2.3
GWHa:ints can also be negative if you want; -1000000.....-6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1...
You start an int very similarly to how you start a string
int catAge = 14;
int tells the computer to expect a number.
catAge is the variable which can be whatever we want
GW:int GlitchWitchIsDaBest = 42;
GWHa:if you want
GWEr:But it's best to keep it sensible.
GWHa:14 is the value we're setting it too.
It's not between "" like it would be for a string beacuase it is just a number.
GWCat:And the computer understands what to do when it's given a number.
