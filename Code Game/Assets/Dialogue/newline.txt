GWHa:You may have noticed there is seemingly no way to make a new line within a string.
GWEr:And what if we wanted our cat's name to be Mo"lly?
Can we not do that either?
GWCat:GOOD NEWS!
we can do all these things and more!
GWHa: when we write a string "abcdefg" we can write a \ where we want our special character.
This tells the computer to insert a special character we can't normally put in our strings.
What character depends on what letter is written after the \
\n is a new line.
This will work like you pressing the enter key on your keyboard.
\" will let you put speachmarks in the middle of strings.
\t will add a tab character.
This is the same as you pressing tab on your keyboard.
any other letter after the \ will give you an Error.
GWEr:But then how do we write \ in our strings I hear you cry?
GWCat:Simple. You just write \\ so your second character is a slash.
GWHa:This means that...
GWHa:"\tHello\"World\\"
Will output as
GWHa:	Hello"World\
