GWHa:If your getting the error that a variable doesn't exsist it means you haven't started it anywhere.
The line number at the end of the message will give you a vague idea what line the variable you haven't started is on.
Remember you need the variable's type to start a variable
string catName = "Molly";
GW:or...
int catAge = 11;
GWEr:If you're pretty sure you have started it there are a few things you should check.
GWHa:Did you start it above where it is being asked for?
GWEr:If it isn't above it the computer doesn't know it exsists.
GWHa:Is it started in a different method?
If you want to use the same variable across multiple methods you need to start outside of any methods
or you can start it in both methods if you don't need to keep the value;
Did you write the variable name correctly both times?
GWEr:Typing mystakes can be a real issue for programmers so make sure to double check.
