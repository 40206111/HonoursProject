Ava:Zombies! Zombies! Zombies! Zombies!
Larry:Next time.
There's just 2 more types of variables I'd like to show you before we get to zombies.
AvaWet:...ok
Larry:First of you need to know about floats.
Floats are started like any other variable...
float floatValue = 5;
We can actually set it exactly the same way we set and int but with the word float instead of the word int.
Ava:So... why is it different to an int?
Larry:Floats can have decimal places...
float floatValue = 5.7f;
Ava:Oh cool! but what's with the f?
Larry:The f tells the computer it is a float without the f it will give you an error.
Ava:Oh ok.
So what's the other variable type I need to know?
Larry:Vector3.
Vector 3s are set different from other variables.
They are also different in that the word Vector3 begins with a capital letter.
Vector3s store 3 float values within them.
Vector3 vec3 = new Vector3();
Writing that will create an empty Vector3 with values (0,0,0).
Vector3 vec3 = new Vector3(1, 2.3f, 7);
Writing that will create a vector 3 with values (1, 2.3, 7).
That should be enough to get you going for now.
I added another variable into the code for you to have a look at.
I will explain it next time.
Ava:LETS GO!
