Ava:Is it time?
Larry:It's time!
Ava:Hooray!!
Larry:So for the zombies you'll need to know about gameobject.transform.position
AvaWet:huh?
Larry:It works like a variable but it gets and sets the zombie's position.
It's a little complicated because you can't work with it directly you need to change a different variable
And then set gameobject.transform.position to that
I've written a little program to try and explain
