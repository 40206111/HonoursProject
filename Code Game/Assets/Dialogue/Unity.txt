GW:You might find I sometimes talk about Unity...
GWHa:Unity is a game engine.
GWCat:In fact it's what was used to make this game!
GWHa:Game engines are used rather than coding video games from scratch all the time because...
GWEr:Coding game engines from scratch can take years.
GWHa:Everything shown in this game can be done in Unity.
GW:Which means if you want something to really challenge you after this you can download Unity.
GW:Maybe you could even try to make a better version of this!
GWHa:You'll need to watch some tutorials to get started but you'll have a basic understanding of the code.
GWCat:Isn't that cool!
