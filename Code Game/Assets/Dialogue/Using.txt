GWHa:You've probably noticed the word "using" at the beggining of your code.
If you've been particularly adventurous you may have even deleted these lines.
If you did that you will have found it made seemingly no difference to the program
GW:This is because...
GWEr:..It makes no difference to the program...
Or at least it doesn't within this game.
GWHa:In the real world usings in the language C# (that's what we're using)
usings tell the computer what commands you want to use.
This means it doesn't have to look through all of the possible ones
GWEr:There are a lot... and that would take a long time.
GWHa:For example using UnityEngine is what allows us to write Debug.Log
As this is a Unity feature.
For this game Larry thought it'd be good to let you see what it looks like with usings.
GWEr:However they do in fact have no effect.
