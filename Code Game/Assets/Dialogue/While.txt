GWHa:Whiles are very similar to ifs.
But where an if will only run its code once, whiles will keep running their code until their condition is false.
in the line...
while (counter < 10){}
Everything between the {} will be run until counter is more than 10
GW:If the counter is never greater than 10 it will run forever.
GWEr:This is fine to do in this game
But outside of it this with crash your program.
GW:You can also check if bool values are true...
while (done == false){}
GWHa:This will run until the bool variable done is true
GWEr:If you haven't been taught what bools are yet...
GWCat:Don't worry we will get to that
