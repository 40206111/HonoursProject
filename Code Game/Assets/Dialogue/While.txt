GWHa:Whiles are very similar to ifs.
But where an if will only run its code once, whiles will keep running their code until their condition is false.
in the line...
while (counter < 10){}
Everything between the {} will be run until counter is more than 10
GW:If the counter is never greater than 10 it will run forever.
GWEr:This is fine to do in this game
But outside of it this with crash your program.
GW:Because I've stopped the while loop from running infinitely you'll notice slightly odd behaviour with the while loop.
GWEr:Each zombie will run the while loop once and then only one will run the rest.
So if you are counting up to 10 it will probably look something like this...
0 0 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
GW:Allowing you to write infinite loops that work like in the real world would cause the game to crash.
GWEr:And that would be a problem.
GWCat:So that is our compromise.
GWHa:You can also check if bool values are true...
while (done == false){}
GWHa:This will run until the bool variable done is true
GWEr:If you haven't been taught what bools are yet...
GWCat:Don't worry we will get to that
