GW:gameobject.transform.position is the most complicated thing I'm going to try and explain to you.
So buckle in.
GWHa:gameobject.transform.position is a built in variable
It stores the position of the zombie it is currently attached to.
It stores the position as three numbers
x which is how far left or right it is.
y which is how far up or down it is.
And z which is how far back or forward it is.
In the form (x,y,z).
For example a gameobject.transform.position of (1,2,3)...
Is 1 unit to the left or right, 2 units up or down and 3 units back or forward.
We can set gameobject.transform.position.
GWEr:But only to another vector3
GWHa:So first we set a Vector3 to gameobject.transform.position...
Vector3 pos = new Vector3(gameobject.transform.position);
GW:Then we change the value of our new Vector3...
pos = new Vector3(pos.x, pos.y, pos.z - 1);
GWHa:We use the vector .x .y or .z when we don't want the position to change or...
we want the change to be based on its previous position
pos = new Vector3(pos.x, pos.y, pos.z + 1); will move the zombie backwards.
pos = new Vector3(pos.x + 1, pos.y, pos.z); will move the zombie to the right.
pos = new Vector3(pos.x, pos.y + 1, pos.z); will move the zombie up.
GWCat:Or we can take away values to make them go in the other direction.
GWHa:We can also use it like other Vector3 variables,
For example...
GWHa:Debug.Log(gameobject.transform.position);
GWHa:or...
float newFloat = gameObject.transform.position.y;
