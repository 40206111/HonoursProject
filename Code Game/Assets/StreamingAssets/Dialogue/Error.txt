GWEr:ERROR CODE:Type: Error Message at line number: line number
GWHa:That should be the format your error message was given in.
The first thing to look at is the line number.
This will give you an idea where to look in your code for the error.
Next read the error message.
This will give you a clue what the computer didn't like.
Finally look at the Error code.
The ERROR CODE tells you what type of error the computer thinks it is.
Normally this will be Syntax
This means you have made an error in typing, spelt something wrong, added too many spaces etc.
Good things to check with syntax errors are...
GWCat:Your capitalisation.
What letters are capitals and what aren't is very important.
Make sure you're ending the line.
Most lines except ifs, whiles, classes and methods need to end in an ;
GWHa:The Error Code: Mathematical happens when there is a problem with your equations.
Look carefully and make sure all your brackets match up.
Compiler Errors are ones where what you are trying just isn't something the computer can do.
For example starting variables with another variable outside of a method.
Type Mismatch Errors happen when you are trying to set a variable to be something it's not.
For example...
GWEr:int example = "five";
GWHa:Would be a Type Mismatch because example is being started as an int.
But it's being set to a string, "five".
The Final type of Error Code you can get is InGame.
This means that what you tried is possible in normal C#...
GWEr:But can't be done in this game.
