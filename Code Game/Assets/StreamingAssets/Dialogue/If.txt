GWHa:If's allow you to do different things depending on a value of a variable.
They are written...
if (variable1 == variable2){}
What is written between () is the case...
and everything between the {} is what will happen if the case is true.
Cases are written (variable1 == variable2)
where variable 1 and 2 can be a variable, a number, a word or another case.
GW:Lets look at this example...
if (catAge == 7)
GWHa:This asks if catAge is equal to 7.
We use two = when we are comparing values which is why it is ==
GW:Another example is...
if (catAge < 7)
GWHa:This checks if catAge is less than 7.
If we use > instead it checks if catAge is more than 7.
GW:And then there's...
if (catName != "Molly")
GWHa:!= checks if something is not equal to something else.
So this happens when catName is NOT equal to "Molly".
GW:Finally there's
if ((catName != "Molly") && (catAge > 7))
GWHa:This will check if both cases are true
If you use && both cases need to be true
You can instead use || (which are found by pressing shift + the button to the left of your z key)
This will check if either case is true
So if catName NOT EQUAL "Molly" OR catAge MORE THAN 7.
If you want something to happen only if the previous if is not true we write else
if (catAge > 7){} else{}
GWCat:And if  we want a condition for that as well we write else if
if (catAge > 7){} else if (catAge == 7){}
GW:We can write as many of these as we want
if (catAge > 7){} else if (catAge == 7){} else if (catName != "Molly"){} else{}
