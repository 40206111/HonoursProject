GWEr:Oh... you did it.
You did everything Larry and I had planned for you...
GWCat:CONGRADULATIONS!
GWHa:Hopefully you have a much better understanding of how to program now.
There are a whole bunch of things you can try in game now...
See if you can get the zombies to move in different directions
GW:Hint: You'll need to use if statements based on their positions
GWHa:You could try and make a triangle by outputting the same letter different amounts of times.
GWCat:And of course you should make sure you've gone through all my explanations
There's a lot of extra detail in them that Larry skimmed over.
GW:And if you're looking for an extra challenge...
You should see if you can try some real world programming
GWHa:When you can, download the latest version of Unity
Look up a tutorial to get you started
GWCat:And start making some cool stuff!
