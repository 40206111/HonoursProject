GWHa:Pressing compile and run gives all the code that's been written to the computer.
The computer then reads it (using it's compiler) and checks it can understand it.
The computer understands C# in this case.
This is the language it speaks. Computers can speak lots of different languages
GW:C++, Java, Python, Ruby, C, Bash, F#, Haskell, Machine code, Pascal, R, Visual Basic... to name a few.
GWHa:but we're using C# for this.
If the computer doesn't understand.
GWEr:It will give back an Error.
And you will have to look through your code to find what it's having problems with.
GWCat:If, however, it understands all the code.
GW:The computer will run the code you gave it.
GWHa: it runs what it's been given in order, top to bottom.
Everything written in the Start method will run once.
Everything written in the Stop method will run until the program is stopped.
GWEr:But you may have noticed that even when written in Start your program runs 3 times.
GWHa:This is because there are 3 Zombies within the Scene.
Every zombie is running the code once.
If you can't see any zombies.
GWCat:Well you'll just have to keep playing.
