GWHa:Debug.Log() is Unity's method for outputting things to console.
The console is the bit on the right you are making text appear in.
it's called Debug.Log because it's a log to help you debug your program.
That means look for errors that aren't found by the computer.
Like checking if the program ever gets into an if statement.
What you want to output must be written between the ()
GWHa:Debug.Log(catName);
If you want it to output words rather than a variable you must write the word between "".
GWHa:Debug.Log("my debug test");
GW:Make sure you have the ; at the end of the line.
