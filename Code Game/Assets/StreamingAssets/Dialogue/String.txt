GWEr:What even is a string?!
GWHa:Well... imagine you're holding a piece of string in your hand.
And on it you thread some letters and numbers...
GWCat:That's what a string is.
It's a bunch of letters and numbers strung together.
GWHa:We can start a new string by writing
string variableName = "";
string tells the computer it should be expecting a string.
variableName is what we will type when we want to use this variable later.
GW:So it can be whatever we want.
GWHa:But it's best to keep it as something we remember what it does...
like catName.
what we want the variable to be needs to be written between the ""
string catName = "Molly";
GWEr:If it's not written between the "" the computer will expect it to be a variable name.
GWHa:Which is fine if you are within a method.
You could have two strings...
string catName = "Molly";
and a new one...
string newCat = catName;
both of these will have the value "Molly"
If you ever want to change what is stored in a variable just do the same as before but don't write string.
catName = "Mollie";
string only needs to be written the first time.
GWCat:That should be all you need to know.
GW:Just remember the ; at the end or it wont work.
