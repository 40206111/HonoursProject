Ava:So how do I make my zombie dance party dream a reality?
Larry:Well I would reccomend the use of the update method.
AvaWet:What's that?
Larry:Up until now we've been writing most of our code in the Start() method.
This runs once when the program is started.
The Update() method will keep running until you stop the program.
Try running this program and see what you think.
