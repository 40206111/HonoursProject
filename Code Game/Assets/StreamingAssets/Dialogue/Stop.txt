GWEr:Sometimes it may look like stop has no effect.
That pressing stop is just a nuisance you have to go through before you can compile your code again.
GW:But this is not the case!
Once you've run your program it will keep running until you tell it to stop.
GWHa:This is so when your code is written in the Update method it can keep running.
This is how video games work. The program needs to run until someone tells it not to.
Otherwise video games would just close on us after a while.
GWEr:Additionally you can sometimes run into a problem in code with "infinite loops".
This is where you write a while loop that is always true.
GWCat:In this game you can stop an infinite loop by pressing the stop button.
GW:BE WARNED HOWEVER!
If you have decide to transfer your programming skills to the real world this will not be the case.
Infinite loops will crash your program and you will lose everything you hadn't saved.
GWHa:So be careful.
