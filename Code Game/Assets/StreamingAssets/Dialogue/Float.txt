GWHa:Floats are set just like ints
float floatVal = 6;
GW:The only difference is that floats can have decimal points in them
float floatVal = 6.5f;
GWHa:But they don't have to.
If you're putting a decimal point make sure you put the f at the end.
GWEr:Otherwise you'll get an error.
GWHa:This is because in full C# there is a type called double that the computer thinks the value is if you don't put the f.
GWHa:Floats are generally better to use though as they take up less computer memory than double.
This is because they can't be quite as large a value.
We rarely need our numbers to be that large though so we use floats.
