AvaWet:I thought I was gonna raise the dead...
That looked like it was about cats...
Larry:We'll get to that. It's better if we start small and build up.
Larry:Shall I explain what I did?
AvaWet:I guess
Larry:I can print out any words I want using "Debug.Log()"
Debug.Log() on it's own wont do anything so we put what we want to print between the brackets.
Debug.Log("Hello World!");
What we want to print needs to be between " or the computer will think it's a variable.
Ava:Wait wait... hold up...
what's a variable?
Larry:A variable is a container that stores information.
AvaWet:...
Larry:They're like boxes you can put things in, but different kinds of boxes store different things.
Lets look at the line: string catName = "Molly";
the word string means it contains letters.
catName is our variable name, that can be anything we want
Ava:Absolutley anything?!
Larry:As long as it's one word and doens't start with a number
Ava:SUPERCALIFRAGILISTICEXPALIDOCIOUS?
Larry:...
Yes... but it's best to keep it sensible.
Finally our cat's name "Molly" needs to be in " so the computer understands that it's letters.
AvaWet:But wait... what does this have to do with Debug.Log?
Larry:Well... now that our cat's name is a variable we can use it anywhere without having to write "Molly" every single time.
Larry:Debug.Log(catName);
And then if we want to change it from Molly, to say "Smokey" we can do that anytime.
After making our variable we can change it by writing the same thing again but removing the string.
catName = "Insert cat name here";
Ava:OK I think I get it. Let me try!
Larry:OK, but this is a lot to take in at once so if you want something explained press the "Help" button.
The Glitch Witch will be happy to help you out.
Ava:Got it!
