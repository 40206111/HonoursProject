Larry:...Not quite yet Ava.
AvaWet:...ok...
Larry:This time we're gonna use whiles and ifs
ifs have a check case and if it's true they run the code within their {}
for example...
if (counter == 5){}
Checks if counter is equal to 5
== means equal to
Whiles also have check cases
But if theirs are true they run all the code in the {} until the case in the while is not true
Ava:I think I get it... but give me an example!
Larry:Ok...
while(counter < 10){counter = counter + 1}
This checks if counter is less than 10 (> would mean more than)
Then counter is increased by 1
The check will then be tested again
This will keep happening until counter is more than 10
Ava:ooh! Neat!
Ava:so I can have my program count as high as I want?
Larry:You can indeed.
Larry:Go try it out
And make sure you talk to the Glitch Witch by pressing the "Help" button
She will explain things in much more detail
