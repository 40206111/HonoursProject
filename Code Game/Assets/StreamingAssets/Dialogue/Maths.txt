GWEr:Maths can be difficult.
GWCat:So in programming we get the computer to do all the maths for us.
GWHa:When we make an equation we can use variable names but only ones that are int, float or Vector3
If we're using a Vector3 we must make sure to specify what part of the Vector we want to use.
When we write our equation + is plus, - is minus, * is multiply and / is divide.
GW:So we can write...
int ourVariable = intVariable + 7 * 6/2;
and then if we wanted to take a float variable away from all of that we would write
int ourVariable = (intVariable + 7 * 6/2) - floatVariable;
GWHa:Anything in brackets will be done first.
Remember that because ourVariable is an int the result of the equation will be rounded to a whole number.
If we want to use our Vector3 variable in our equation we could write
float outVariable = intVariable + Vec3Variable.x - Vec3Variable.z;
GWEr:If some of these things don't make sense to you...
GWCat:You might not have been taught them yet.
So be patient.
