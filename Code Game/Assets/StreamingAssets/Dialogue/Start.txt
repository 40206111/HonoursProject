Nothing ever happens here.
Larry:You could make something happen.
AvaWet:What do you mean?
Larry:You can make whatever you want, be the creator of worlds, OF LIFE.
Ava: OF LIFE?!
Larry:That's right.
Ava:I want to make, unicorns... no no dragons... no no...
I want to raise the dead!
Larry:You want to raise the dead?
Ava:Gonna have a zombie dance partaaayy!
AvaWet:...how do I do that?
Larry:Programming!
Larry:You can make whatever you want if you know how to program.
AvaWet:But... I don't.
Larry:I shall teach you then.
Ava:Great!
Larry:To start with I'll write some code for you too look at.
Nothing too complicated but don't worry if you don't understand. I will explain later.
Press "Compile and Run" to see what the program does and "Stop" to stop it.
Try changing some of the code and see what happens.
Press "continue" when you're ready to move on.
